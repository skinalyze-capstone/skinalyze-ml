Secondly, it prevents pores becoming blocked by the skin’s natural shedding process, which makes it harder for this bacteria to populate inside the pore to cause a blemish (it needs an oxygen-free environment to thrive).\\r\\n\\r\\nStudies have also shown azelaic acid to inhibit melanogenesis (production of melanin), so also has benefits in treating hyperpigmentation and post-inflammatory acne scarring. It has good skin tolerability, so can be used to treat more sensitive skin types in concentrations of around 10%.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is a family of ingredients, the other ingredient including Potassium Azeloyl Diglycinate.  Azelaic acid is a naturally occurring acid derived from grains, such as wheat, barley, and rye. It is used in skincare for its multifunctional properties, including its ability to brighten the skin, reduce hyperpigmentation, reduce redness, and address acne-prone skin.                                                                                                        Azelaic acid has antibacterial properties making it a good supplementary ingredient in the treatment of acne. It has anti-inflammatory properties making it a very effective treatment for rosacea, redness, and acne inflammation, and It has mild exfoliating properties and interferes with the melanin production process in the skin making it an effective ingredient for brightening and evening out the skin.

AHAs work by dissolving the keratin binding the outermost layer of skin cells, speeding up the skin’s natural exfoliation process. This leads to smoother, brighter, clearer skin, whilst reducing skin discolouration & fine lines/wrinkles with continued use.\\r\\n\\r\\nGlycolic acid has the smallest molecular weight of all the AHAs, meaning it can penetrate the skin quickest, producing the fastest results, but also most likely to cause skin sensitivity, so it is best for those with fairly tolerant skin types.                                                         Glycolic acid is a type of alpha hydroxy acid (AHA) derived from sugarcane or synthesized from other natural sources. It is used in skincare for its potential exfoliating, brightening, and skin-renewing properties.  Glycolic acid offers benefits such as:\\r\\n- Provides chemical exfoliation by dissolving dead skin cells on the skin's surface, promoting a smoother and more even skin texture.\\r\\n- Assists in improving the appearance of fine lines, wrinkles, and hyperpigmentation by stimulating collagen production and skin cell turnover.\\r\\n- Can help unclog pores and reduce the occurrence of acne and blackheads.\\r\\n- Enhances the absorption and effectiveness of other skincare ingredients in products applied afterward.

       "16         Retinol  Retinol, is a part of the vitamin A family of ingredients and is one of the most well-researched actives used in skincare today. Retinol and all of its derivatives are broken down within the skin first into retinaldehyde, then into retinoic acid, the active form recognised by the body to trigger its skin benefits.\\r\\n\\r\\nRetinoic acid (aka tretinoin) is the gold standard of anti-ageing and works in a number of ways. Firstly, it blocks the production of collagen-degrading enzymes, meaning collagen does not get broken down as quickly in the skin. After prolonged use (6M+), it has also been shown to stimulate the production of type I and type III collagen, reducing wrinkles and improving skin firmness. It has been shown to protect against UV-induced damage, as well as reducing the appearance of hyperpigmentation in the skin. Skin treated with retinoids is smoother, more even-toned, firmer and younger looking.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is part of a family of ingredients also found on ingredients lists as encapsulated retinaldehyde, hydroxypinacolone retinoate, retinaldehyde, retinyl palmitate, retinyl propionate and retinyl retinoate (8x more powerful than retinol)                                                                                One of the most well researched and versatile cosmetic ingredients available, retinol is a powerhouse ingredient that is effective at smoothing, firming, brightening and evening out the skin.

It can be a great option to reduce any over-stimulation of the sebaceous glands, which can occur with excess cleansing (and make breakouts worse).

It is structurally very similar to our skin’s own sebum, so is a great ingredient to support our own natural skin processes. In drier skin, which is naturally lacking in natural sebum, it helps to support the skin barrier to prevent water loss, which results in more hydrated, smooth and plump skin. Due to its sebum-mimicking structure, it is non-comedogenic, meaning it won't cause breakouts, so is also suitable for oily and acne-prone skin. It can be a great option to reduce any over-stimulation of the sebaceous glands, which can occur with excess cleansing (and make breakouts worse). It also works to support the skin barrier to combat any drying effects caused by ingredients commonly associated with acne treatment, so is a great ingredient for all skin types.                                                                                                                                                                    Squalane is a stable and lightweight form of squalene, a natural compound found in the skin's sebum. In skincare, it is used for its potential moisturizing, emollient, and skin-balancing properties.                                                           Squalane offers benefits such as:\\r\\n- Acts as a highly effective emollient, providing immediate and long-lasting hydration to the skin, helping to improve moisture retention and maintain a soft and supple complexion.\\r\\n- Forms a protective barrier on the skin's surface, preventing moisture loss and protecting the skin from environmental stressors.\\r\\n- Can help balance oil production, making it beneficial for individuals with oily or acne-prone skin.

       "113            Retinol  Retinol, is a part of the vitamin A family of ingredients and is one of the most well-researched actives used in skincare today. Retinol and all of its derivatives are broken down within the skin first into retinaldehyde, then into retinoic acid, the active form recognised by the body to trigger its skin benefits.\\r\\n\\r\\nRetinoic acid (aka tretinoin) is the gold standard of anti-ageing and works in a number of ways. Firstly, it blocks the production of collagen-degrading enzymes, meaning collagen does not get broken down as quickly in the skin. After prolonged use (6M+), it has also been shown to stimulate the production of type I and type III collagen, reducing wrinkles and improving skin firmness. It has been shown to protect against UV-induced damage, as well as reducing the appearance of hyperpigmentation in the skin. Skin treated with retinoids is smoother, more even-toned, firmer and younger looking.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is part of a family of ingredients also found on ingredients lists as encapsulated retinaldehyde, hydroxypinacolone retinoate, retinaldehyde, retinyl palmitate, retinyl propionate and retinyl retinoate (8x more powerful than retinol)                                                                                                                                                                           One of the most well researched and versatile cosmetic ingredients available, retinol is a powerhouse ingredient that is effective at smoothing, firming, brightening and evening out the skin.                                                                                                                                                                                     This ingredient is an antioxidant that stimulates collagen production, treating fine lines, wrinkles and a reduction of elasticity in the skin which can naturally come with aging.

It has several benefits in skincare including as an anti-inflammatory, with evidence showing great results in treating rosacea symptoms (swelling & redness) via this mechanism.\\r\\n\\r\\nAzelaic also has an anti-blemish activity - firstly, it is an antibacterial which works to kill acne-causing bacteria, P.Acnes. Secondly, it prevents pores becoming blocked by the skin’s natural shedding process, which makes it harder for this bacteria to populate inside the pore to cause a blemish (it needs an oxygen-free environment to thrive).\\r\\n\\r\\nStudies have also shown azelaic acid to inhibit melanogenesis (production of melanin), so also has benefits in treating hyperpigmentation and post-inflammatory acne scarring. It has good skin tolerability, so can be used to treat more sensitive skin types in concentrations of around 10%.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is a family of ingredients, the other ingredient including Potassium Azeloyl Diglycinate.  Azelaic acid is a naturally occurring acid derived from grains, such as wheat, barley, and rye.

    "Retinol, is a part of the vitamin A family of ingredients and is one of the most well-researched actives used in skincare today. Retinol and all of its derivatives are broken down within the skin first into retinaldehyde, then into retinoic acid, the active form recognised by the body to trigger its skin benefits. Retinoic acid (aka tretinoin) is the gold standard of anti-ageing and works in a number of ways. Firstly, it blocks the production of collagen-degrading enzymes, meaning collagen does not get broken down as quickly in the skin. After prolonged use (6M+), it has also been shown to stimulate the production of type I and type III collagen, reducing wrinkles and improving skin firmness. It has been shown to protect against UV-induced damage, as well as reducing the appearance of hyperpigmentation in the skin. Skin treated with retinoids is smoother, more even-toned, firmer and younger looking. It is part of a family of ingredients also found on ingredients lists as encapsulated retinaldehyde, hydroxypinacolone retinoate, retinaldehyde, retinyl palmitate, retinyl propionate and retinyl retinoate (8x more powerful than retinol)\n",

Caffeine energizes the skin and helps reduce the appearance of fatigue or tiredness. It provides a temporary tightening effect, improving the appearance of sagging or loose skin. It may help reduce the appearance of puffiness or swelling, particularly around the eyes. It even offers potential antioxidant benefits, protecting the skin against free radicals and environmental stressors.

It is structurally very similar to our skin’s own sebum, so is a great ingredient to support our own natural skin processes. In drier skin, which is naturally lacking in natural sebum, it helps to support the skin barrier to prevent water loss, which results in more hydrated, smooth and plump skin. Due to its sebum-mimicking structure, it is non-comedogenic, meaning it won't cause breakouts, so is also suitable for oily and acne-prone skin. It can be a great option to reduce any over-stimulation of the sebaceous glands, which can occur with excess cleansing (and make breakouts worse). It also works to support the skin barrier to combat any drying effects caused by ingredients commonly associated with acne treatment, so is a great ingredient for all skin types.

Vitamin C is also involved in the collagen-production process, so provides anti-wrinkle activity through this mechanism. Lastly, Vitamin C inhibits the enzyme tyrosinase, which is involved in melanin-synthesis, and can therefore visibly reduce areas of hyperpigmentation in the skin.\\n\\nVitamin C is a family of ingredients also known as ascorbic acid, ascorbyl glucoside, ascorbyl palmitate, ethyl ascorbic acid, l-ascorbic acid, magnesium ascorbyl phosphate, sodium ascorbyl phosphate and tetrahexyldecyl ascorbate.

       "28              Retinol                Retinol is a part of the vitamin A family of ingredients and is one of the most well-researched actives used in skincare today. Retinol and all of its derivatives are broken down within the skin first into retinaldehyde, then into retinoic acid, the active form recognised by the body to trigger its skin benefits. Retinoic acid (aka tretinoin) is the gold standard of anti-ageing and works in a number of ways. Firstly, it blocks the production of collagen-degrading enzymes, meaning collagen does not get broken down as quickly in the skin. After prolonged use (6M+), it has also been shown to stimulate the production of type I and type III collagen, reducing wrinkles and improving skin firmness. It has been shown to protect against UV-induced damage, as well as reducing the appearance of hyperpigmentation in the skin. Skin treated with retinoids is smoother, more even-toned, firmer and younger looking. It is part of a family of ingredients also found on ingredients lists as encapsulated retinaldehyde, hydroxypinacolone retinoate, retinaldehyde, retinyl palmitate, retinyl propionate and retinyl retinoate (8x more powerful than retinol).

       "19              Retinol                Retinol is a part of the vitamin A family of ingredients and is one of the most well-researched actives used in skincare today. Retinol and all of its derivatives are broken down within the skin first into retinaldehyde, then into retinoic acid, the active form recognised by the body to trigger its skin benefits. Retinoic acid (aka tretinoin) is the gold standard of anti-ageing and works in a number of ways. Firstly, it blocks the production of collagen-degrading enzymes, meaning collagen does not get broken down as quickly in the skin. After prolonged use (6M+), it has also been shown to stimulate the production of type I and type III collagen, reducing wrinkles and improving skin firmness. It has been shown to protect against UV-induced damage, as well as reducing the appearance of hyperpigmentation in the skin. Skin treated with retinoids is smoother, more even-toned, firmer and younger looking. It is part of a family of ingredients also found on ingredients lists as encapsulated retinaldehyde, hydroxypinacolone retinoate, retinaldehyde, retinyl palmitate, retinyl propionate and retinyl retinoate (8x more powerful than retinol).

It is structurally very similar to our skin’s own sebum, so is a great ingredient to support our own natural skin processes. In drier skin, which is naturally lacking in natural sebum, it helps to support the skin barrier to prevent water loss, which results in more hydrated, smooth and plump skin. Due to its sebum-mimicking structure, it is non-comedogenic, meaning it won't cause breakouts, so is also suitable for oily and acne-prone skin. It can be a great option to reduce any over-stimulation of the sebaceous glands, which can occur with excess cleansing (and make breakouts worse). It also works to support the skin barrier to combat any drying effects caused by ingredients commonly associated with acne treatment, so is a great ingredient for all skin types.                                                                                                                                                                    Squalane is a stable and lightweight form of squalene, a natural compound found in the skin's sebum.
